      <h1>Why Initial <span class="text-danger">D</span> is Legendary?</h1>
      <p class="h3">
        I can say this anime has big effect on life. It's change my all life
        totaly, okay now we can talk about why its legendary?. The main reason
        is in 90's and 80's there is no JDM or Drifting culture like this years.
        When this anime released, It's like a bomb because everything is just
        perfect. I don't wanna give spoiler but its all about feeling of
        drifting and hype when you watch first time the first episodes are
        little boring but after first race you want to watch more and more, if
        you already like drift you gonna buy ae86 or rx7 after this series
        because its just legendary. And there is no series like Initial D its
        Japan Legend and Initial D is famous all around world. When I have
        depress or suicidal feeling I just watch this series and its totaly make
        me happy and strong for future. <br />
        The Final thing is Initial D musics are legendary level when you listen
        dejavu or nigh of fire you can feel the beast energy and hype on you :)

      <p class="h3">
        The AE86 series of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno
        are small, front-engine/rear-wheel-drive models within the
        front-engine/front-wheel-drive fifth generation Corolla (E80)
        range—marketed by Toyota from 1983 to 1987 in coupé and liftback
        configurations. Lending themselves to racing, the cars were light,
        affordable, easily modifiable and combined a five-speed manual
        transmission, optional limited slip differential, MacPherson strut front
        suspension, high revving (7800 rpm), twin-cam engine with oil cooler
        (e.g., in the US), near 50/50 front/rear weight balance, and
        importantly, a front-engine/rear-drive layout—at a time when this
        configuration was waning industry-wide. Widely popular for Showroom
        Stock, Group A, and Group N, Rally and Club racing, the cars' inherent
        qualities also earned the AE86 an early and enduring international
        prominence in the motorsport discipline of drifting. The AE86 was
        featured centrally in the popular, long-running Japanese manga and anime
        series titled Initial D (1995–2013)—as the main character's drift and
        tofu delivery car. In 2015, Road & Track called the AE86 "a cult icon,
        inextricably interwoven with the earliest days of drifting."[12] The
        AE86 would go on to inspire the Toyota 86 (2012–present),[13] a 2+2
        sports car jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured by
        Subaru—and marketed also as the Toyota GT86, Toyota FT86, Scion FR-S and
        Subaru BRZ. In November 2021, Toyota temporarily restarted the
        production of a limited number of parts for the AE86, and dealers began
        taking orders for new steering knuckle arms and rear brake calipers.
        Rear axle half shafts have also been scheduled for new production.
        Toyota also announced that this reboot is temporary, and parts will be
        available only as long as stocks last.

        The term 'JDM' is an acronym for Japanese Domestic Market; it's a
        reference to the fact that these cars are meant to be produced in Japan
        and sold to people living in Japan. Oftentimes, people will refer to all
        Japanese cars as JDM, even if they are sold in the United States. This
        is a misconception and you must understand the difference. If a car is
        made in Japan and sold on the international market in the United States,
        Europe, or elsewhere, it is not a JDM car. JDM cars often have specific
        features and quirks that are meant to fit in with Japanese car culture
        and laws, which is one of the reasons they are so sought after by
        automotive connoisseurs who are looking for something different. If you
        are a car enthusiast, and especially one who loves unique,
        outside-the-box vehicles, you may have heard and wondered about the
        meaning of the JDM car before. JDM cars are vehicles that are produced
        in Japan specifically for the Japanese market and are not meant to be
        sold in other countries. These cars are marketed toward people who live
        in Japan, unlike some Japanese cars, which are designed to be sold in
        the United States such as the Honda Civic or the Toyota Corolla. While
        JDM cars are not necessarily meant to be sold in the United States, they
        are sometimes imported by people who are interested in owning unique
        vehicles. Just like with any car, there are benefits and drawbacks to
        owning one of these cars. Understanding what JDM means and how these
        cars are unique can help you decide if one of them is right for you.
